Singularity recipe files for the APSIM Classic version of the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator

## Maintainer Notes

- Recipes for APSIM 7.9 use the upstream SVN repository (no longer available)
- Please see comments inside the recipes for the reasons why some upstream files are overwritten during the build process
- The Cotton Model requires a password, which needs to be obtained by the model owner and placed under `files/CottonPassword.txt`
